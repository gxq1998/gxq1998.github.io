I am a final-year PhD candidate at the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Yale University, where I am fortunately co-advised by [Prof. Chi Liu](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/chi-liu) at [Yale Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Center](https://medicine.yale.edu/pet/) and [Prof. Nicha Dvornek](http://www.hellonicha.com/) at [Yale Image Processing and Analysis Group](https://medicine.yale.edu/bioimaging/ipa/people/). In summer 2023, I was an AI software engineer intern at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/) (Knoxville, TN) working on generative data harmonization. In summer 2022, I was an image analytics intern at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/) (Malvern, PA) working on weakly-supervised segmentation. Before coming to Yale, I did my undergraduate study at Shanghai Jiao Tong University fortunately supervised by [Prof. Jun Zhao](https://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyDetail/76). 

My research interests are medical image analysis and medical computer vision, specializing in but not limited to registration, generation, segmentation, and denoising for dynamic PET, CT, and MRI.

I am actively looking for **full-time positions**. Please feel free to contact me at [xueqi.guo@yale.edu](mailto:xueqi.guo@yale.edu) and find my CV [here](https://gxq1998.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Jul23.pdf).
