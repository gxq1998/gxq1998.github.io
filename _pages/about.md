I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Yale University, where I am fortunately co-advised by [Prof. Chi Liu](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/chi-liu) at [Yale PET center](https://medicine.yale.edu/pet/) and [Prof. Nicha Dvornek](http://www.hellonicha.com/) at [Yale Image Processing and Analysis Group](https://medicine.yale.edu/bioimaging/ipa/people/). In summer 2022, I was a research intern at Siemens Healthineers (Malvern, PA) working on weakly supervised segmentation. Before coming to Yale, I did my undergraduate study at Shanghai Jiao Tong University supervised by [Prof. Jun Zhao](https://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyDetail/76). In summer 2018, I was an undergraduate research intern at Johns Hopkins University, fortunately under the supervision of [Prof. Web Stayman](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/j-webster-stayman/) and [Dr. Grace Gang](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/grace-gang/) at [AIAI Lab](https://aiai.jhu.edu/). 

My research interests are medical image analysis and medical computer vision, specializing in but not limited to registration, denoising, and segmentation for dynamic PET, CT, and MRI.

I am actively looking for summer internship positions in summer 2023. Please feel free to contact me at xueqi.guo@yale.edu and find my CV [here](#).
