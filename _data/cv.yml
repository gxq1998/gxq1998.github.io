        - title: Weakly supervised abnormal texture segmentation for interstitial lung diseases (ILD)
          contents:
             - Expanded Self-supervised Equivalent Attention Mechanism (SEAM) for the high heterogeneity of ILD lesions.
             - Introduced an adaptive background thresholding strategy for the brightness differences in activation maps.

      institution: Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.
      year: 2018
      description:
        - title: Low dose CT denoising by generative adversarial network (GAN)
          contents:
            - Incorporated sharpness detection into the generator and achieved better performance handling streak artifacts (PSNR = 35.30).
            - Optimized the performance of GAN by ascertaining the optimal number of residual layers in the generator and modifying the discriminator and loss function, thereby boosting the network's efficiency by 30%.
        - title: Analyzation of Denoising Network Responses
          contents:
            - Analyzed the denoising network's impulse response and disc response under different attenuation coefficient values; obtained the average and standard deviation maps.
            - Tested the network's learning pattern by phantom and real CT image datasets in different noise levels and different reconstruction algorithms.
            - Examined the network's sensitivity threshold of lung nodule radius through simulation.
